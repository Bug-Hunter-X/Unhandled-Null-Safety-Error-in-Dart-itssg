# Unhandled Null Safety Error in Dart

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart related to null safety.  The `_myVariable` can be null and isn't always explicitly checked. This can lead to runtime errors if not handled correctly. The solution shows a proper way to handle potential null values using the null-aware operator (`??`) or null checks.
